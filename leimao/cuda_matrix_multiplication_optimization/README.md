# cpp data alignment

This code referenced to [cuda matrix multiplication optimization](https://leimao.github.io/article/CUDA-Matrix-Multiplication-Optimization/).

The algorithms implemented here are still slower than cuBLAS FP16 GEMM.

A complete implementation of the algorithms ported in this file are available at this [CUDA-GEMM-Optimization link](https://github.com/leimao/CUDA-GEMM-Optimization).

## Setup

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
